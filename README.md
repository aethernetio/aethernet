# Aethernet.io

The aether is the clear blue skies beyond the clouds.  Aethernet is the network going beyond the clouds.  It is a distributed platform for creating decentralized applications geared towards collaboration, civilized discussions, and sharing of resources, knowledge, art, and entertainment.

## Why Aethernet?

We believe in fairness, equality, and independence.  We value truth, justice, knowledge, and creativity.

We should have a society, economy, and monetary system that reflect these beliefs and values.  Our system should be based on merit rather than wealth, power, or control.  Money should be earned and spent, not used to create more money.

Our current system is rigged to favor those who have wealth, power and control.  Rules regarding wealth, money, and income are set by those with the most wealth, money, and income.  The rules regarding power are controlled by those in power.  The rules regarding who sets these rules are controlled by those that set the rules.

We are kept in control through dependence and divisiveness, discouraging us from working together to change the rules to be fair rather than favor the few.

By creating our own decentralized platform with its own decentralized monetary system we can change who sets the rules.  

We can create our own fair economy based on our own values of merit, knowledge, creativity and independence.  

We can have real debates without fear of distractions caused by divisive and misleading "talking points", and we can agree to disagree when we have differences, yet we can still work together and solve problems where we have common cause.

We can have a platform and atmosphere that encourages people to work together and share knowledge and resources while retaining our independence and self sufficiency.

In short, the purpose of Aethernet is to return the power and control back to the people.

## What is Aethernet?

Aethernet is a distributed platform for creating decentralized applications geared towards collaboration.

The platform includes a software center, which allows you to install third party applications and run them in a sandbox on your own hardware, protecting you and your data.

Through the use of our synchronization technology, you can work offline or online.  You can synchronize through the internet, ad-hoc networks, or even through encrypted files stored on external storage devices such as USB drives or memory cards.

You can connect to your own secure private network, share with other people on secure encrypted shared networks, and share as you wish with the public on the public network.
